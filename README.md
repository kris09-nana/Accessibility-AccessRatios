# Accessibility-AccessRatios
Hi HUMAN!
These python codes are to calculate accessibility and access ratios based on the E2SFCA, M2SFCA, and 3SFCA methods. 

What is the meaning of "Accessibility" here ?
Here, accessibility means the accessibility to public facilities. 
It is used to detect the distribution of public facilities, such as primary schools, hospitals, or even job opportunities. 
Using this indicator, we could identify which districts/areas in cities/regions has inferior provision of certain resource.

What is E2SFCA, M2SFCA, and 3SFCA method? 
FCA: floating catchment area method.
FCA methods calculates accessibility of one population unit (such as a community, census block, or census tract) as the sum of supple-demand ratios of the facilities are nearby to the unit. The facilities are in the catchment (buffer zone) of the population unit, and the popluation unit is within the catchment of the facilities too. 

2SFCA: the two-step floating catchment area method. 
E2SFCA: the enhanced two-step floating catchment area method.
M2SFCA: the modiefied two-step floating catchment area method.
3SFCA: the three-step floating catchment area method.
